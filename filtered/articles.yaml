  excerpt: |
    What can you do? You can’t artificially lower the murder rate – how do you hide the bodies when it’s the state health department that controls the medical examiner’s office? But the other felony categories? Robbery, aggravated assault, rape? Christ, what they did with that stuff was jaw-dropping.

  excerpt: |
    Of the 1,449 killings committed in the city between 1997 and the end of last year, 32 percent resulted in the arrest and conviction of a suspect on murder charges, a computer-assisted analysis shows. In the remaining 68 percent of those murders, no one was ever arrested, or the people who were arrested either went free or were sent to jail for short periods of time on lesser charges. In 37 percent of the 1,449 murders, no one was ever charged; in 7 percent of the cases, a suspect was charged but the charges were dropped; in 12 percent, the suspects were acquitted in court; and in the remaining 12 percent, a suspect was convicted of a lighter charge.

  excerpt: |
    Some police precincts now routinely log no killings in a given year. Citywide, homicides plummeted to 333 in 2014, the lowest since comparable statistics started to be kept a half-century ago, from a peak of 2,262 in 1990 when crack-cocaine drove so much of the city’s violence.

    The 40th Precinct, though, remains one of a few areas where homicides have persisted, feeding off the isolation of poverty and turf rivalries among criminal crews that linger despite the neighborhood’s progress in undoing some of its history as an emblem of urban blight.

  excerpt: |
    When we couldn’t find the data published anywhere, we contacted the departments — and as a byproduct got some insight into the wide variation in crime-reporting capabilities even among the nation’s biggest cities. Some departments got back to us within a couple of hours (e.g., Phoenix and Raleigh, N.C.). Several had the data on their website, broken down by month and going back several years (Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Riverside, California). Others treated the inquiries as public-records requests and said they’d need up to 10 days to get back to us (Anaheim, California).
