# One: Everyone lies


# Two: The victim is killed once, but a crime scene can be murdered a thousand times.


# Three: The initial ten or twelve hours after a murder are the most critical to the success of an investigation.

# Four: A guilty man left alone in an interrogation room goes to sleep.


# Five: It’s good to be good; it’s better to be lucky.

# Six: When a suspect is immediately identified in an assault case, the victim is sure to live. When no suspect has been identified, the victim will surely die.


# Seven: "First, they're red. Then they're green. Then they're black."

# Eight: "In any case where there is no apparent suspect, the crime lab will produce no valuable evidence. In those where a suspect has already confessed and been identified by at least two eyewitnesses, the lab will give you print hits, fiber evidence, blood typings and a ballistic match."


# Nine: A. "To a jury, any doubt is reasonable."
B. "The better the case, the worse the jury."
C. "A good man is hard to find, but twelve of them, gathered together in one place, is a miracle."

# Ten: There is too such a thing as a perfect murder

> You find a body in the street and it’s a murder. You sketch him, take his picture, check his pockets, roll him over. In that instant and for a few hours afterward, he’s all yours, so much so that after a couple of years you don’t think about it anymore. But once he’s in the ground, once a preacher says some words and the dirt is on top of him, it’s just different. Never mind that this is nothing more than a muddy field, never mind that the exhumation is a necessary investigative act— for Waltemeyer, it’s still hard to believe that he has any right messing with a body in its final repose. Naturally, his colleagues reacted to such doubts with all the warm sincerity for which Baltimore cops are known and admired. All the way through roll call this morning they had piled it on: Christ, Waltemeyer, what the fuck kind of asshole are you? We don’t have enough murders to deal with in this fucking town, you got to go prancing around the goddamn cemeteries like Bela fucking Lugosi, digging up skeletons?

Burial represents more than just a physical boundary; but the buried sometimes can't remain buried.

And Waltemeyer knew they had a point: In terms of criminal culpability, the exhumation seemed a bit redundant. They had Geraldine and her contract killer, Edwin, on three homicides and the repeated attempts on Dollie Brown. They had Geraldine and another triggerman charged with a fourth murder in the death of Albert Robinson, the old drunk from New Jersey found by the Clifton Park

Rayfield Gilliard, age seventy-eight, then the doctors on Penn Street could still do something with this case. Even with a body that had been in the ground for ten months, an adulterant could still be detectable. Twenty prescription Valium, ground into a last meal of tunafish— yes indeed, Smialek told Waltemeyer as they agreed to get the exhumation order, if that’s what we’re looking for, that’s what we’ll find.

> Rule Ten in the homicide handbook: There is too such a thing as a perfect murder. Always has been, and whoever tries to claim otherwise merely proves himself naive and romantic, a fool who is ignorant of rules one through nine. A case in point: Here lies a black male by the name of Anthony Morris, twenty-one years of age, shot dead in the western half of Baltimore, Maryland. A young man of suddenly declining status in the local drug trade, Mr. Morris is found by Western uniforms in an empty courtyard of the Gilmor Homes, where a person or persons repeatedly compressed the trigger of a .38-caliber weapon and thus caused several small pieces of metal alloy to rip holes in Mr. Morris’s body.
